# Full-Stack Svelte Template with TypeScript and SCSS

This is a fork of a project template for [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) apps. It lives at https://github.com/raxdiam/svelte-fullstack (formerly https://github.com/sveltejs/template).

To create a new project based on this template using [degit](https://github.com/Rich-Harris/degit):

```bash
npx degit raxdiam/svelte-fullstack svelte-app
cd svelte-app
```

*Note that you will need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) installed.*


## Get started

Install the dependencies...

```bash
cd svelte-app
npm install
```

...then start [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org):

```bash
npm run dev
```

Navigate to [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000). You should see your app running. Edit a component file in `src/frontend`, save it, and reload the page to see your changes.

If you're using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) we recommend installing the official extension [Svelte for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=svelte.svelte-vscode). If you are using other editors you may need to install a plugin in order to get syntax highlighting and intellisense.

## Building and running in production mode

To create an optimised version of the app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can run the newly built app with `npm run start`.
